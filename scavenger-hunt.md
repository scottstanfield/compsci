For this Scavenger Hunt, you don't need to use nano (unless you mess up). 

Redirection will append to an existing file if you use `>>`

# Scavenger Hunt

1. Make a folder `~/code/hunt`

2. Within that folder, create a new file called `results.txt` and put your username at the top (your login).

3. UNIX word dictionary. Use Google to find the location of this file.

  a. Find all the 3-letter English words that have no vowels. Put those words in `results.txt` using redirection.

  b. Find the middle word in the dictionary, and put it at the end of the file. Hint: `wc`, `head`, `tail`

  c. Count the number of words that have "fox" in them; put the count at the end of the file.

4. File manipulation
  
  a. Copy the dictionary file to a new folder `~/code/hunt/dictionary`

  b. Find all the words with 'apple' in them, and save to a new file called `apple.txt` in the `dictionary` folder.

5. Decode this into English. Spaces below are for your benefit:  
        
        456e 6967 6d61 2043 6970 6865 722e

   Put the answer at the bottom of your results.txt file.

6. Use the `tree` command from the `~/code/hunt` folder to get a nice listing of all your files. You might need to install it. Include the option to show the **size** of each file. Append the output to results.txt.

7. Print `results.txt` and hand it in. You can use either TextWrangler or TextEdit to print.
