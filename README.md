Go to System Preferences, locate Mouse and enable the right-mouse
button.

[Spectacle](http://cl.ly/RQLx) is a free window resizer program. 

The Spectacle [website](http://spectacleapp.com/) shows a good
demonstration of the capabilities.

[TextWrangler 4.5.3](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html) is a free code editor and a 
better replacement for TextEdit.

Pin it to you start menu.

## Python

* [Dive into Python](http://www.diveintopython.net)
My favorite book jumps right in. It may assume you have some programming
knowledge, but I like the detail in each chapter.

* [Python Learn](http://www.pythonlearn.com/book_007.pdf) is a more
  traditional book, that builds from very little starting knowledge.

## vi(m): the best text editor
We're not going to learn vim in class, but some of you have expressed an
interest. Use these links to learn more:

- [VIM Adventures](http://vim-adventures.com/)  
- [Interactive Tutorial](http://www.openvim.com/tutorial.html)

There's a great [grahical cheatsheet](http://www.viemu.com/a_vi_vim_graphical_cheat_sheet_tutorial.html);
just focus on Lesson 1 for now.

Also, [the vi(m) learning curve is a
myth](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/13164810557/the-vim-learning-curve-is-a-myth).


## HTML5 Links

I learned HTML5 from (Dive into HTML5)[http://diveintohtml5.info/]
