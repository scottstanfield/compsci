## Mac Setup

### 1. ShiftIt
[ShiftIt v1.6](http://cl.ly/3p071K0S2B0y/download/ShiftIt-1.6-NoX11.zip) lets you arrange windows using keyboard shortcuts. 
This is a special build that doesn't require the use of X11, a infrequently used library of code. After unzipping, 
drag it to your Applications folder and run it.

### 2. TextWrangler
[TextWrangler 4.5.3](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html) is a free code editor and a 
better replacement for TextEdit. 
1. Double-click on the TextWrangler_4.5.3.dmg
2. Drag the icon to the Application shortcut
3. Launch the program
4. Skip the registration
5. You may be prompted for your credentials...this is an important step

Pin it to you start menu.

Also:
