## Python

Installing [iPython](http://ipython.org/) the interactive Python:

1. Apple doesn't install a C language compiler on your Mac, and it's
   needed by many programs. Install from the command line tools.

2. Install the `brew` program from [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)

`
	% brew doctor  
	% brew install cowsay  
	% cowsay 'brew is awesome'  
`

The `brew doctor` command might ask you to modify your path, so that
`/usr/local/bin` is in your path before `/usr/bin`. Follow those
instructions.

3. Upgrade your Python. Apple does ship a version of `python` with OS X,
   but there are extra features we need, only available by customizing
   our installation. Follow these steps

   easy_install ipython[all]  
   iptest   
   brew install pyqt  


* [Dive into Python](http://www.diveintopython.net)
My favorite book jumps right in. It may assume you have some programming
knowledge, but I like the detail in each chapter.

* [Python Learn](http://www.pythonlearn.com/book_007.pdf) is a more
  traditional book, that builds from very little starting knowledge.

## vi(m): the best text editor
We're not going to learn vim in class, but some of you have expressed an
interest. Use these links to learn more:

- [VIM Adventures](http://vim-adventures.com/)  
- [Interactive Tutorial](http://www.openvim.com/tutorial.html)

There's a great [grahical cheatsheet](http://www.viemu.com/a_vi_vim_graphical_cheat_sheet_tutorial.html);
just focus on Lesson 1 for now.

Also, [the vi(m) learning curve is a
myth](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/13164810557/the-vim-learning-curve-is-a-myth).


## HTML5 Links

I learned HTML5 from (Dive into HTML5)[http://diveintohtml5.info/]
